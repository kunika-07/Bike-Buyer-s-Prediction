# Bike-Buyer-s-Prediction

The project "Car Buyer Prediction: Comparative Analysis of Classification Algorithms" involves using machine learning algorithms like LR, NB, SVM, KNN, DT, RF, and Adaboost to predict car buyers based on a dataset containing factors like income, age, gender, and marital status. The project evaluates each algorithm's performance using classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, aiming to identify the most effective algorithm for predicting car buyers.
